**Project Title: Patient Readmission Prediction for Healthcare Analytics**
A predictive model to identify patients at risk of hospital rediscovering. This project uses machine learning to analyze clinical data and help healthcare providers with early intervention and improved patient care.

**Key Features:**

Problem: Predict patient readmission within one year.

Methodology: Utilized data science pipeline from cleaning and feature engineering to model building and evaluation.

Dataset: patient_clinical_treatment_data.csv (11,500 entries)

Model: A Random Forest Classifier was trained to identify patterns in the data.

Outcome: The project demonstrated how data analysis can inform clinical decisions, with the model providing a foundation for predicting patient risk.

**What I Did:**

Data Cleanup: I took the raw patient data and cleaned it up, making sure all the information was in a format the computer could understand.

Smart Features: I created new features, like BMI (Body Mass Index) and days since diagnosis, to give the model better information to work with.

Building a Predictor: I used a machine learning technique called a Random Forest Classifier to build a model that can learn patterns from the data and make predictions.

Checking Results: I checked how well the model performed by looking at its accuracy. This helped me see if it was making good predictions or just guessing.

**Technologies Used:**

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook
